# Iterated

Functional methods (e.g. `pipe`, `map`, `group`) to work with Javascript Iterablesâ€”with prime
typing support.

```shell
npm install iterated
```

```typescript
import it from 'iterated'

it.map([1, 2, 3], x => x)
it.count('AAAABBBCCD')
```

We can work with `pipes` of data, processing sync and async iterables
transparently.

```typescript
const result = it.pipe(
  [
    { foo: 1, baz: 'x' },
    { foo: 2, baz: 'x' },
  ],
  it.map((item) => item['foo'])
)
```

In the case above, Typescript inferences that `result` is an `Iterator<number>`.

`AsyncIterator` is amazing when handling promises:

```typescript
const result = it.pipe(
  [true, false, true],
  it.map((x) => Promise.resolve({ success: x })),  // eg. fetch something from a server
  it.await, // await each promise, returning an async iterator
  it.filter(({ success }) => success), // now filter function doesn't have to handle any promise
)
```

In the case above, Typescript inferences that `result` is of
type `AsyncIterator<{success: boolean}>`. If we want to enforce getting an array...

```typescript
const myArray = await it.pipe(
  result,
  it.array
)
```

In the case above, Typescript inferences that `myArray` is of type `{success: boolean}[]`.

Working with iterators means that:

* The library is speedy and introduces little overhead (that's because we iterate
  with [`for ... of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)).
* We only iterate once.
* RAM consumption is low, as we don't compute intermediate data structures (unless required by the
  algorithm).
* We are compatible with any other library accepting the iterator protocol.
* We support arrays, strings, Maps, Sets...
* Makes extending this library easy and in a decoupled way.

Extending the library is as follows:

```typescript
function doStuffWithDevices(devices: Iterable<Device>): Iterable<Device> {
}

const result = it.pipe([{ id: 'device-1' }], doStuffWithDevices)
```

Functions with multiple arguments require adaptation to work in a pipe (i.e. curry).
You can achieve it simply by doing:

```typescript
import { toPipe } from 'iterated'

function doStuffWithDevices(devices: Iterable<Device>, aParam: () => number): Iterable<Device> {
}

const doStuffWithDevicesPipe = toPipe(doStuffWithDevices)

const result = it.pipe([{ id: 'device-1' }], doStuffWithDevicesPipe(() => 5))
```

Checkout how we curry in our code for more intricate examples.

## Contributing

Fixes, improvements, and issues are welcomed.

We can add more functions (I am myself thinking of adding `tee` and `zip`), although I
wouldn't like to have an explosion of them, specially if there are easily composable.

Functions should allow currying and working with sync and async iterables transparently,
and have good Typescript support.
